# data-structures-and-algorithms
This repository is a review and implementation on the fundamental data structures and algorithms of programming concepts.
## Running it on your computer
### Data Structures
Each data structure is in its own folder, with it's respective *.h* and *.cc* file. In the same directory, there is a test file, 
which will make use of the implemented class in unit tests.
Download the repository and go to the directory of the data structure of interest and run `make all`, then 
`./[data-structure-of-interest]-test`. You will then have the test file run on your computer and will be able to look at 
the code files to learn more.
